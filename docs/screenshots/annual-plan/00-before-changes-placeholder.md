# Screenshot Placeholder: Before Implementation

**Filename**: `00-before-changes.png`

**Description**: 
This screenshot shows the Annual Plan page BEFORE the current implementation changes. It would have shown:
- Static mock data loading automatically
- KPI cards always visible
- Table always showing with horizontal scroll potentially
- No ProcessStepper sidebar
- No dynamic content switching

**Changes Made**:
1. ✅ Added ProcessStepper sidebar with 11 RBIA stages
2. ✅ Implemented dynamic content area (empty state by default)
3. ✅ Plan loads only after creation/selection
4. ✅ Table optimized to avoid horizontal scroll with fixed columns
5. ✅ Content switches between stages
6. ✅ Working delete functionality for tasks
7. ✅ Step completion tracking (Annual Plan stage marked complete after loading)

**Technical Improvements**:
- API endpoints added for plan and task management
- State management with contentView, activeStepId, currentPlanId
- Smooth scroll to top on stage navigation
- Table with fixed layout and proper text wrapping
- Conditional rendering of KPI cards
