## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issue #1: Dashboard Bundle Size ⚠️
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Dashboard First Load JS is 226 kB (target: <200 kB)  
**Impact:** Slightly slower initial load on slow connections  
**Recommendation:** 
- Implement code splitting for chart components
- Lazy load dashboard widgets
- Defer non-critical JavaScript

**Target:** Reduce to <200 kB in Phase 7

### Issue #2: EmptyState TypeScript Warnings
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:** `actionLabel` prop not defined in EmptyState interface  
**Impact:** TypeScript warnings during build (non-blocking)  
**Recommendation:** Update EmptyState component types  
**Status:** Pre-existing issue, not Phase 5 related

### Issue #3: Bulk Delete Undo Not Supported
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Undo only works for single operations, not bulk  
**Impact:** Users cannot undo bulk delete operations  
**Workaround:** Delete items individually to enable undo  
**Recommendation:** Implement bulk action history in Phase 7  
**Status:** Documented as enhancement

### Issue #4: Dynamic Route Build Warning
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:** `/api/admin/kpis` shows static rendering warning  
**Impact:** None (route works correctly)  
**Recommendation:** Add `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`  
**Status:** Cosmetic warning only
